Operation Sack Lunch project repo for SeattleGiveCamp 2017
# Project Request
Our app would be a matching tool connecting OSLâ€™s Food In Motion Program, which rescues and redistributes more than a million pounds of food annually, with Seattle area restaurants, grocers, farms and other food distributing organizations. Each time a business has excess viable food they simply post it to their profile on the app. Each post will appear in a searchable marketplace similar to OfferUp or Craigslist. The food will be processed through our Food In Motion program and offered to other hunger relief organizations with a chain of temperature custody and release of liability.
