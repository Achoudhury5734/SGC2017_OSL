Operation Sack Lunch project repo for SeattleGiveCamp 2017

# Organization Mission Statement 
OSL is a non-profit with a 28-year history of providing no-cost meals that are nutritionally dense and safe to all those who struggle with hunger in our community. We do this through the creation and delivery of nutritionally dense, no-cost meals, and by being instrumental in advocating for and supporting an equitable food system for all. We currently serve more than 700,000 annually; 3 meals a day, 7 days a week. 

# Project Request
Our app would be a matching tool connecting OSLâ€™s Food In Motion Program, which rescues and redistributes more than a million pounds of food annually, with Seattle area restaurants, grocers, farms and other food distributing organizations. Each time a business has excess viable food they simply post it to their profile on the app. Each post will appear in a searchable marketplace similar to OfferUp or Craigslist. The food will be processed through our Food In Motion program and offered to other hunger relief organizations with a chain of temperature custody and release of liability.
